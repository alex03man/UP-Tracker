# UP and Ease'm
A Mobile Application that will track data regarding Utility Poles (UPs), along with geolocation, images and the paths they follow. I plan to also include Easement tracking later in the applications lifecycle.

## Data Dictionary
Below is a list of all data that this application will be able to track along with a short description/definition.

1. Pole ID - Unique Identifier for individual poles that are in use by the utility companies.
2. Pole Name for various utilities - Tags that have been attached by various utilities for their tracking purposes.
3. Class (Ex. 5-30) - The Classification of the UP which defines height and width. (https://events.cnr.ncsu.edu/conclave/Pole-Class-Tables.pdf)
4. Material - The material the UP is made of.
5. Utility Attachment Heights - Heights the Utility Company has attached cables or equipment to.
6. Street or Field - Which side the cables are on with regard to the roads and property.
7. Boxed - whether or not the cables on this pole have been street side on one, then field side on the next, then street side again.
8. GPS coords - Coordinates for the location of the utility pole.
9. Next Pole - This is the pole the cables are leading to, normally it is only one.

## Future Features
Below are some of the potential features dreamt up to make this project a success.

- Mark each pole as a marker using google maps or other mapping tools.
- using the line or polygon tool draw the poles and how they connect via cables.
- Be able to store this locally and push it off to a GIS or Relational DB within the business.
- Store them on a public database for future use by utility companies.
- Search by street.
- Define Start of utilities or POP location.
- make ready.
- Easement tracking.
- Joint Use Application Filing.
